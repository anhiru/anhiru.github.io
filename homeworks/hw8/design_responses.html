						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>
              I learned about dark patterns: its history, big picture impacts, and possible solutions.
              A dark pattern is a user interface that has been carefully crafted to mislead or trick users into doing things they don't really want to.
              This is contrary to good user experience design, where the design has the user's best interests at heart and is neither deceptive nor sneaky in nature.

						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>
              My favorite part of the article was the first section, which took a deep dive into the history of dark patterns.
              The first section also illustrated different types of dark patterns and provided relatable examples for each one.
              As someone who has previously been exposed to a vast majority of these dark patterns, it was enlightening to see them all categorized and explained in great detail.
