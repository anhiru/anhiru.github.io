							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
                I learned about several individual principles commonly associated with Gestalt theory.
                These principles include but are not limited to proximity, similarity, closure, continuation, and common fate.
                Visual design and psychology are linked, and recognizing their connection can help us determine which visual elements are most effective in any given situation.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
                My favorite part of this article involved the many examples of the Gestalt principles in action.
                Being a visual learner myself, these diagrams really helped me understand how each principle applied to UI design.
                I loved that each section had its own accent color, which was a clever testament to the principle of Similarity.
