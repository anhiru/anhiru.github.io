							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
                I learned that whitespace plays a huge role in visual organization of a page.
                Whitespace helps maintain focus on the content, define the page layout, and increase readability.
                I learned that more often then not, "less is more" when it comes to user experience and design.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
                My favorite part of this article involved the visual examples of good and bad whitespace.
                The author drew from his personal experiences at Wayfair, an e-commerce home store.
                These examples really helped me understand the thought process behind creating webpages as a product designer.
