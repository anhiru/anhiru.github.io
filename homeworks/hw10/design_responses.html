							<p>What are your thoughts on this article and its topic? Did it influence your opinion in any way? What were some interesting examples (good or bad)? (4-5 sentences)</p>
							<p>
                I strongly agree with the premise of the article: UX and psychology go hand in hand.
                Understanding the process of human cognition goes a long way towards implementing effective product design. 
                I especially enjoyed the everyday examples provided for the different types of attention, e.g. driving and talking is a good example of divided attention.
                As a student of UX design, I need to be aware of intensive changes in environment and reduce cognitive overload for my users.
