                        <li>
                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>
                              I learned that transitions are a significant aspect of UI interactions. 
                              Smooth transitions make the entire product feel smooth, sleek, and modern. 
                              Additionally, I now know that a weekly email digest exists for inspiring design-related content, and I'm all for it!

                            <p>
                              I enjoyed previewing all of the designs in the article. 
                              Each design had a different theme and conveyed its own unique message. 
                              Personally, I tried to guess the purpose of each mockup before reading their respective titles. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>
                              My favorite inspiration was the "Add to Cart Interaction" by <a href="https://dribbble.com/dannniel" target="_blank">Dannniel</a> for <a href="https://dribbble.com/norde" target="_blank">Norde</a>. 
                              It was truly unlike any shopping cart interaction I have ever seen before. 
                              The personalization options were fun, clean, and extremely fluid. 
                              I loved how each customization involved complementary animations, i.e. a measuring tape for the sizes, color swatches for the colorways, etc.
                            </p>
                        </li>
