							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
                I learned that accessibility comes in many different forms.
                Whether it be something as integral as the core functionalities of a product or something as auxiliary as the color scheme of a website, 
                accessible design plays an essential role in creating an inclusive web for people of all backgrounds.
                I learned that there are many online tools to help designers create more accessible products.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
                My favorite part of this article was the quick tips section.
                Here, I learned many different ways to ensure the creation of color-accessible products, 
                including color/focus state contrast and incorporating messages to relay crucial system information.
                As a visual learner myself, I particularly appreciated the fact that there were examples in each subsection labeled "Do This" and "Don't Do This".
