							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
                I learned that knowing how to choose type is one of the most important skills you can have as a designer.
                Typography plays a huge role in bringing text to life by promoting legibility and conveying a brand message.
                I learned that there are many online resources to help choose the perfect type for a certain task.

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>
                My favorite part of the article was determining font size.
                It never dawned on me why certain font ratios felt more aesthetically pleasing than others.
                Now, I understand the concept of the golden ratio and it was super neat seeing the math involved!
                I also appreciated <a href="https://www.modularscale.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Modular Scale</a>, a tool the author provided to generate these perfect font sizes.
